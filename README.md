# Orthobot

A simple game engine using Javascript modules in a way that avoids the need for any third party dependencies or compilers.

## Instructions

Open the index.html file in a browser via a localhost.

## Plan

* Like paradroid
* Level built from blocks
* Transfered as string of characters
* Character is tile or npc
* Player can grapple and shoot
* Tap is shoot.
* Hold extrudes grapple.
* Take over npc with grapple
* Take over takes quick mini game
* Bigger Npc has advantage 
* Maybe no mini game but hostage is just bigger meat shield
* Npc have rock/paper/scissor properties
* Npc have light cone restricting vision
* Obstacles have rock/paper/scissor properties
* Objective is place bombs or steal data's
* After last objective exit opens but npc's on alert
* Add perspective foreshortening factor to overlap and compress y positions globally. Tiles closer to camera will overlap those further away slightly.
* When tethering player is anchored.
* Thetered bots are reeled in. The reeling has to be a minigame or button mash struggle to avoid idle time.
* Movement input perpendicular to the tether direction breaks the link
* Bigger bots reel slower 
* Tethered bots shoot at player, who is very vulnerable 
* Damage is inflicted on a health pool with constant regen with an elemental advantage/disadvantage.
* Tether is like arm in bionic commando. Or the inflator in dig dug
* Cute version: frog in a bee suit üê∏ üêù
* Unrender offscreen objects
* Use webassembly for calculations
* Shot cool down built in firing state.
* Scope instead of model. Limited scope.model. Only cosmetic attribs in Dom using get and set.
* Measure interval for performance to compare scope model to Dom 
modelling
* Tiles in 2d array.  Bots havs lookup function
* Guard Bots have Dormant state until alarm. Or triggered when passed through vision. But not when right posesses colour.
* Can bot next col/row be float
* Primary and secondary are not booleans but count interval to store how long they are pressed.
* Shots fire when button released current/next
* After long enough held start reeling. 
* Take overs leave discarded heads and/or discarded old bodies.
* Heads are crt screens with face.
* Player is bodyless head with wire tentacles.
* Bot:before is health bar - Bot:after is head
* Bot bodies look like vintage PC cases with wheels and tracks and a super soaker like weapon. 
* Bubbling tank, wake flame, rocket pods for the various elements.
* Retry and skip links. Goal also uses skip link
* Server has array of levels to increment through.
* Projectile:before/after for vapour trail
